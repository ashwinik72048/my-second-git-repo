A paragraph is a unit of writing focused on a single idea or topic, organized using several related sentences that typically begin with a topic sentence and are supported by details and examples, with the entire unit presented as a distinct section of text, often with an indent at the beginning of the first sentence. Paragraphs serve to structure writing, making it easier to follow the author's thoughts and convey information clearly
